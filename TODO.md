# TO-DO

Potential changes:

- Use React to modularize the code.
- Ask client to provide images of the menu items. Then, display the images with the item elements.
- Instead of displaying the sections (starters, pasta, pizza etc.) one after another, create a navigation bar. So that each section is displayed as a single-page.
- Make the style responsive for mobile devices.
